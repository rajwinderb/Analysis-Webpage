        <p>Average daily demand has decreased since before lockdown, with the range of demand also decreasing during the day as represented 
            by the Full System Demand in blue. This indicates smaller peaks in demand during the day. Total demand has increased slightly

        <p>
            Here, we have looked at a longer trend of electricity generation in the UK, in terms of the fuels used and 
            the effect of lockdown on the mix of fuels compared to previous trends. There was a fall in total electricity 
            demand which coincides with a fall in electricity demand as the weather becomes warmer, although there appears 
            to be a greater fall in demand compared to the previous year, 2019. In order to try to determine the effect of 
            the lockdown more closely on the mix of fuels, we have looked at the changes in fuel types between 2018 - 2019 
            and 2019 - 2020 (below).
        </p>

        <h4>Change in energy fuel mix (2018-19) and (2019-20)</h4>

        </section>

        <p>
            Note: The percentage increase of coal is large between 2019 and 2020, however relatively it remains a small part 
            of the energy mix, ex. in February 2020 it was 5% of the energy mix compared to 6% in February 2019.
        </p>

        <h4>Total Electricity Generation and associated CO2 Emissions</h4>

            </a>
        </section>

        <p>The effect of lockdown, as we have seen previously has decreased total electricity generation. The fall in supply was 
            greater compared to 2019 between February and April, and supply has remained lower for months following. In comparison, 
            the Total CO2 Emissions from electricty supply also fell by a similar degree however appears to increase between May and 
            June, compared to supply which appears to show a continued trend from the previous three months (April - June). 
            For eighteen days in April the grid ran without any coal, for reasons including good weather as well as lower demand, 
            which could be the reason for the uptick in Total CO2 emissions between May and June (2020).

        <p>One could be cautiously optimistic when seeing the home office energy consumption per person being lower than 
            the office building energy consumption per person, as a positive indication of home office scenario being better 
            in terms of kgCO2 emissions for the environment. <br> <br>

            However, even though it looks as if Home Office Energy Consumption falls below the Office Buildings Energy 
            Consumption, it still is not a perfect representation of the home office category. There are definitely limitations 
            in this analysis due to the assumptions that were made, but some insightful points could still be taken from it. <br> <br>
            
            The largest component that could lead to the 'Home Working' to be a much preferred choice is when considering the 
            component of CO2 emission when travelling to work.

        <h3 class="post">Post-Lockdown: Use of Transport Modes</h3>

        <p>As shown by the two figure above, when lockdown started in the UK there was a sharp decline in the usage of all modes of transport compared 
            to what we would expect to see normally. As lockdown restrictions eased cars climbed back up to a near normal level but still a small decrease 
            overall nevertheless. However, even though public transport usage grew as well this was not at the level of cars as well and is not near its 
            normal levels.<br /> <br>

            Although, in comparision cycling levels increased 2-fold as lockdown started. This did not last though as cycling dropped back down to normal 
            levels as lockdown restrictions have been lifted, and may also be partially due to exercise during lockdown.<br /> <br>
            
            From this we can see that even though many office workers were remaining at home to work but other workers were gradually going back to work and 
            people were making more journeys in cars for other reasons. This decline in car usage is seemingly superfical.<br /> <br>
            
            Overall, even though there has been a reduction of all vehicles on the road the best sustained reduction would've been best to seen in cars the 
            largest contributor to greenhouse emmissions, yet positively the levels of car usage is still lower then previously which is moving in a good direction.
        </p>

        <h4>
            Focus: London
        </h4>

        <p>
            Using an Office for National Statistics <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/datasets/trafficcameraactivity" target="_blank">Experimental dataset for busyness indices</a>, 
             focusing on the busy city of London, it is interesting to understand how traffic has actually changed on the roads. Even though this is limited to one 
             city it is a good insight into the traffic in a city during COVID-19 and as Londoners as previously mentioned spent the longest time commuting this would 
             be valuable insight to see what the effects of people working from home. <br />

            This data counts the amount of each mode so would be interesting to see the percentage change from the first day recorded  <strong>11th March 2020</strong> to 
            the  <strong>day after</strong>: Lockdown started, 1st Lockdown Easing, 2nd Lockdown Easing, 3rd Lockdown Easing and 4th Lockdown Easing.

        </section>

        <p>From the start of Lockdown the levels of cars dramatically decreases and then rose again as lockdown restrictions were lifted again, however, 
            still at a lower level than normal. This mirrors the general trend show in the 'Use of Transport Modes in the UK since 1st March 2020' figures. <br> <br>

            Further the levels of of buses has decreased but not at the same rate as cars and has only seen small fluctuations and has not moved back to 
            normal levels. Comparing this to the 'Use of Transport Modes in the UK since 1st March 2020' we can see that Transport for London Buses usage 
            also dropped justifying these results. <br> <br>
            
            More interestingly the levels of motorbikes has increased. This could be due to the increase in food deliveries that people were getting to 
            there home, or could be favoured over other transport modes. <br> <br>
            
            The levels of pedestrians and cyclist dropped the most and has stayed at the biggest percentage decrease. Following on from the increase in 
            motorbikes, London had a larger level of lunches being delivered to offices (easiest on bikes) which still remains low due to offices remaining closed. <br> <br>
            
            Similarly to previous analysis, even though there is a a general decrease in cars and buses, a sustained decrease in car usage would be greater 
            impactful but this is still a possibililty as there is a reduction. More worryingly, the increase in motorbike usage may counter balance other 
            modes of transport, an increase is always worrying to see if it emmits emmissions. The large drop in office usage may be the reason why bus and 
            car levels have dropped in a heavily corporate city indicating work from homes benefits to road busyness.
        </p>

        <section class="tgraphs3">
            <h4>Further Effects of Transport Changes</h4>
            <p>There are many effects that could be found that have resulted from this droping in car and other transport mode usage, two that can be explore 
                are: Fuel prices and Co2 Emmissions</p>
            <div class="pic"> 
                <h4>Fuel Prices</h4>
                <a class="photos" href="src/fuel.png"><img src="src/fuel.png" width="1008px" height="576px" alt="graph"></a> 
                <h4>Effect: Fuel Prices</h4>
                <p>
                    From before lockdown started the price at the pump of both Petrol and Diesel was reducing, This further reduced as Lockdown started and has
                        been slow to rise. A statement from the <a href="https://www.ukpra.co.uk/en/bulletins/71" target="_blank">Petrol Retailer Association</a> states that many petrol 
                        stations will have to close as fuel sales dry up. Here also states: "Petrol consumption was down by 75% and diesel by 71% which indicates
                        that the Government’s “stay at home” instructions to combat the coronavirus pandemic are being heeded". 

                    Showing that the demand for fuel most definitely dropped indicating the reduced usage of cars in the lockdown period.
                </p>
            </div> 
            <div class="pic"> 
                <h4>Co2 Emmissions</h4>
                <a class="photos" href="src/co2.png"><img src="src/co2.png" width="1008px" height="576px" alt="graph"></a> 
                <h4>Effect: Co2 Emmissions</h4>
                <p>
                    From the Figure above we can see a reduction of Co2 emmission around the start of Lockdown in the UK highlighting that 
                    the reduction of cars and other vehicles may have had an impact in reducing the amount of greenhouse gases emitted in the UK. 

                    This is an important indication that reducing vehicles on the road will infact reduce emmissions and possible what the UK 
                    should push to see.
                </p>
            </div> 
        </section>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>As Lockdown eases we can see an increase in the usage of cars again and this has not been seen in public transport, further the reduced fuel prices 
               and the possibility of crowded public transport may lead to more people using their cars more often. <br> <br>

            People remaining at home not travelling to work, especially seen in office workers, has highlighted the impact commuting plays in our road transport 
            levels. This reduction that lockdown induce showed the drop in levels of emmission that is gained from reducing our vehicles on the road. Further as 
            office workers stay working from home and possible in the furture remain working from home in some capacity, the country could see a somewhat lower 
            level of vechiles on the road and in turn reducing emmissions.

    <section class="future">
        <h3 class="pre">Energy</h3>

        <p>The effect of lockdown, we have seen is a fall in demand for energy nationally, as well as a different pattern of 
            demand during the day. On supply, the mix of energy has changed, with renewables and coal showing an increase on 
            the previous year, for the first six months of 2020. <br> <br>

            The effect of lockdown on energy demand is that overall demand has fallen has fallen, due to businesses being 
            closed or operating at limited capacity (where we have seen that industrial demand in particular has fallen). 
            Domestic demand remains more constant, but the changes in timing of demand during the day, where the peaks are 
            less than before lockdown which indicates a smoother daily demand 'curve'. This could help with managing renewable 
            sources in the grid, where smaller peaks mean renewables are more able to manage demand and backups are required 
            less when they are unable to meet demand. Working from home could be an explanation for the lower peaks, and 
            encouraging this can help keep demand more 'constant'. However, as weather is one of the main factors in energy 
            demand, it would be necessary to continue tracking energy demand during the Winter. One way the government is 
            trying to reduce this demand is through their 
            <a href="https://www.iisd.org/sustainable-recovery/news/green-recovery-stimulus-for-uks-housing-sector/), in providing vouchers for the public to make their homes more energy efficient, where [homes in the UK are not energy efficient](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50573338">'Green Homes Grant' scheme</a>. 
            The effectiveness of this scheme compared to people returning to offices will need to be established. <br> <br>
            
            Emissions from energy have been falling throughout the previous 30 years, and this trend must continue if the UK is 
            to meet it's Carbon targets and net-zero by 2050. What lockdown has shown is that with a lower energy demand 
            (and good weather), the grid is able to manage a greater share of renewables in the electricity mix meaning 
            lower associated emissions from supply. Continuing to increase the capacity of renewables in energy will lower 
            the associated emissions from electricity generation. This will allow a greater ability to meet the targets, 
            where the UK remains off-track to meet its' target this year, despite a record-breaking year, of eighteen 
            consecutive days without coal. The government currently supports Offshore wind and provides funding for 
            low-carbon technologies. Compared to other countries, the Green Recovery package has been small with 
            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-commits-350-million-to-fuel-green-recovery">£350 million committed</a>, 
            compared to <a href="https://www.businessgreen.com/news/4016109/green-recovery-germany-unveils-plans-eur40bn-climate-spending-surge">€40 billion</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/03/france-launches-big-green-recovery-plan-part-100bn-stimulus-covid">€30 billion</a>
            (£37 billion and £27 billion) for Germany and France respectively. Ensuring a greater commitment of funding to 
            these projects will spur a Green post-Covid recovery.</p>

        <h3 class="pre">Transport</h3>
        <p>We need the governement to make public transit safe and not push people away from it completely. 
            This could be a perfect time to expand the public transport in the UK to host larger capacity so we firstly can introduce more saftey and space 
            to limit the spread of COVID-19 as well as future-proofing our public transport network. Further as office workers still mostly remain working 
            from home for the moment it give more opportunity to do so soon. <br> <br>

            Additionally the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-cities-postpone-clean-air-zone-plans-due-to-covid-19-crisis" target="_blank">delaying of Clean Air Zones</a> 
            in the UK could delay the reduction of emmissions and car usage we saw in London from happening in other major cities and need to ensure this does take 
            place and not delayed further. Transport emmission are particularly important as <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/862887/2018_Final_greenhouse_gas_emissions_statistical_release.pdf" target="_blank">Government</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.energy-uk.org.uk/publication.html?task=file.download&id=6602" target="_blank">Industry</a> reports have highlighted that transport is the largest contributors 
            to our greenhouse gas emmissions. Further, road transport has also been reported to be the main source of air quality pollutant emissions from transport 
            by the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/890898/energy-and-environment-notes.pdf" target="_blank">Departement of Transport</a>. <br> <br>
            
            As highlighted above the reduction of cars and other vehicles on the road did lead to a decrease in Co2 emmissions a greenhouse gas. This idicates the 
            push to decrease usage of cars and a greater push to public transport as this is the best way to allow people to travel in a fast and clean way. 
            Therefore in order for the UK to meet its Clean Air Sustainability target the make up of our transport modes need to be looked at. <br> <br>
            
            The Government plans to ends the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2040, however this does not push people to more energy efficient cars such as electric and hybrid cars just second-hand petrol and diesel cars which may not be better for the environment. There needs to be a push and incentives toward purchasing efficient vehicles as if public transport is not improved in the drastic way, cars will remain essential to peoples lives.</p>
